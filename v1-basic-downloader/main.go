=====================================
üß† Program Walkthrough (Concurrent File Downloader)
=====================================

1. We define a map called `urls` that holds:
   - The file's download URL (as the key)
   - The name we want to save it as locally (as the value)

2. We initialize a `sync.WaitGroup` named `wg`:
   - This helps us keep track of how many downloads are still running
   - We‚Äôll wait for them all to finish before exiting the program

3. For each entry in the `urls` map:
   - We call `wg.Add(1)` to increment the counter
   - We launch a new goroutine using `go downloadFile(...)`
     ‚Üí Each file download runs in parallel, not one after another

4. Inside `downloadFile`:
   - We defer `wg.Done()` so the counter is decremented when the function finishes
   - We make an HTTP GET request to fetch the file
   - If successful, we create a local file and write the downloaded content to it
   - Any errors are logged using `fmt.Printf`

5. Back in `main()`:
   - We call `wg.Wait()` to block execution until ALL downloads finish

6. Once all downloads are complete:
   - We print a final message to the console

===============================
üèÅ Result:
- All files in the map will be downloaded at the same time (concurrently)
- Each file is saved with its own name in the current directory
===============================
